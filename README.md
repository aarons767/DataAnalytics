## Initials
1. To start off, run the cleaner_script.sh file.  This shell script takes 3 arguments and make sure to run the following files to ensure no errors:
  - sh cleaner_script.sh
  - US-Gun-Violence.csv
  - cleaned.csv
  - no_missing.csv

2. Run the python_analyzer.py only after running the cleaner_script because python_analyzer.py expects a normalized, clean file called "no_missing.csv" to exist in the working directory

## Additional Info
In addition to the graphs generated by the python_analyzer.py, the cs131_data_analytics_project.py file is primarily used to data analysis from Google Colab.
